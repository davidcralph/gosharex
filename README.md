# gosharex
ShareX uploader but in Go so it's very fast

I made this as part of learning Go, so it's probably bad code. I don't recommend running it in production.

## Installation
1. Install Go and all dependencies
2. Rename .env.example to .env and change info
3. Either run the server with ``go run main.go`` or build with ``go build main.go`` and run the binary
